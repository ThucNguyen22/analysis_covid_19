## Project Overview
Welcome to my case_study. In this repository, I explore the Covid-19 dataset using Python for data analysis. My goal is to uncover insights and countries have deaths rate and recoveries rate highest.
<h5 align="center"> This project is a part of "Data Science‚Äù curriculum as capstone projects at<a href="[https://www.almabetter.com/](https://www.coderschool.vn/vi)"> Coderschool </a> </h5>


## Tools Used
- Python 
- Pandas   
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
## Data transform
1. Data loading and inspectation
2. Handling missing values
3. Visualize
## Exporatory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial for understanding the dataset, rate, trends, and insights. In this section, I explore various aspects of the dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of the content available on dataset, addressing key questions:

1. **Write a function that reports the latest situation of the Corona Virus in a given country:**
2. **Tthe situation in every countries until October 31st, 2020.:**
3. **Until October 31st, 2020, among the top 5 countries identified, which country/countries should we pay special attention to:**
## Results
- Brazil, France, and the US needed to address their medical solutions due to their high death rates. Brazil had the highest rate at nearly 2.8, followed by France and the US. Countries with significantly lower death rates were India (1.49) and Russia (1.72).

- The US and France had to focus on improving their medical solutions as their recovery rates were alarmingly low, with France having the lowest at 2.6%. In contrast, India demonstrated effective treatment with a recovery rate of nearly 91.53%, followed by Brazil (90.38%) and Russia (75.23%).

- Despite Brazil experiencing a considerable death rate, its recovery rate was notably high, ranking second only to India. Conversely, France faced challenges in finding solutions to reduce the death rate and increase recovery rates, as it ranked second highest in death rate and lowest in recovery rate.

## Reference
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Github. The Dataset provides comprehensive information on the number of infections and deaths through 2023. The data set is freely accessible on Github, a platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. You can find the original dataset on github.
